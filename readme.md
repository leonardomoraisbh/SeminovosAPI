##Backend Test

The objective of this test is to assess your level of knowledge in the technologies and tools we will be using. You will need to implement a solution for a common use case in our software.

The test can be completed in many different ways and levels of detail. Try not to limit yourself and use as many tools, modules and tricks as you can. Also, pay attention to the quality and clarity of your code and the extensibility of your proposed solution. The design and architecture are mostly open, so you will have to make sensible decisions about it. These are the things that will make you stand out from the crowd.

The code should be open-sourced in a public repository as the origin of the data used is also public. If you choose to make it private, please provide the necessary credentials to access it.

## Task

The website seminovosbh.com.br is a local portal to search used cars. We need that stock of cars in our services. To do so, you gone crawl the website.

Using PHP, you must provide a RESTful endpoint to search the crawled cars (according the existing filters in the website. No need to be all of them, just the main ones) and another endpoint to view the details of a selected car.

Also, you should give to us all the info about how to run and test your API. Tip: A documentation of your API will be very welcome.

Good look!
