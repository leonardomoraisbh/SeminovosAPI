#Backend Test

The objective of this test is to assess your level of knowledge in the technologies and tools we will be using. You will need to implement a solution for a common use case in our software.

The test can be completed in many different ways and levels of detail. Try not to limit yourself and use as many tools, modules and tricks as you can. Also, pay attention to the quality and clarity of your code and the extensibility of your proposed solution. The design and architecture are mostly open, so you will have to make sensible decisions about it. These are the things that will make you stand out from the crowd.

The code can be open-sourced in a public repository as the origin of the data used is also public. If you choose to make it private, please provide the necessary credentials to access it. You can also make a public or private fork of this same repository.

The deadline for delivering your solution is One week after receiving this test.

## Task

The ANP (Agência Nacional do Petróleo) provides public information about the costs of different types of fuel all over the country. We need that information but unfortunately they don’t provide a web service or any easy way to get it. Therefore, we have to crawl the site to obtain it.

The data must be obtained from the ANP site. We recommend choosing the ‘Por Estado’ option and going deeper from there.

Using Node.js or PHP, you must provide a RESTful service endpoint that uses the data obtained to return it as a JSON. This request must take less than a second in average, so we recommend that you don’t obtain the data every time.

Good look!
